We are installing the Anaconda environment from the official website. After downloading the RPLY library ($conda install -c conda-forge rply).
My programming language consists of an unsigned integer type, a real type, a conditional operator ("если"), a loop with a precondition ("пока"), and a rounding operator("округлить"). 
Each line ends with a ";", except for the line at the beginning of the block. The block starts with "{", ends with "};". 
Real numbers are separated by ".". Functions must return something. Identifiers and functions can consist of both Russian and English letters, as well as numbers.
The function call consists of its name and "()". The conditional operator and the loop so far consists of the name and "(execution condition) {code block};".
